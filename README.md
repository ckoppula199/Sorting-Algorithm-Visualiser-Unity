# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser-Unity
A program made using C# and Unity to provide visualisations of common sorting algortihms. Highlights comparisons and swaps.

Currently has visualisations for the Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.

In the future I plan to add visualisations for the quicksort algorithm as well.
