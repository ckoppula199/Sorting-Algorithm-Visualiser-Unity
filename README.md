# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser-Unity
A program made using C# and Unity to provide visualisations of common sorting algortihms. Highlights comparisons and swaps. YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDJjQx-fgtg&t=255s  

Currently has visualisations for the Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.

In the future I plan to add visualisations for the quicksort algorithm as well.
